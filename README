NAME
    autobox::JSON - bringing JSON functions to autobox

VERSION
    version 0.0006

SYNOPSIS
        use autobox::JSON;

        say {name => 'Jim', age => 34}->encode_json;
        # {"name":"Jim","age":46}

        my $person = '{"name":"Jim","age":46}'->decode_json
        # {name => 'Jim', age => 34}

        my $serialized_person = $person->encode_json;
        # {"name":"Jim","age":46}

        # works on arrays too
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]->encode_json;

METHODS
  encode_json
    This method behaves the same as "encode_json" in JSON.

  encode_json_pretty
    This method is identical to "encode_json", except that it also
    "prettifies" the output, making it easier for us mortals to read. This
    is useful especially when dumping a JSON structure to something
    reasonable for, say, debug or other purposes.

    It is functionally the same as:

        JSON->new->utf8->canonical->pretty->encode($ref)

  decode_json
    This method behaves the same as "decode_json" in JSON.

DEPRECIATED METHODS
  to_json (depreciated)
    This method behaves the same as "to_json" in JSON.

    This method is depreciated because the JSON documentation itself prefers
    encode_json.

  from_json (depreciated)
    This method behaves the same as "from_json" in JSON.

    This method is depreciated as the JSON documentation itself prefers
    decode_json.
